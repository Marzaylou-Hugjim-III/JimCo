### Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

#### Martha
- I take feedback well, willing to take on assigned task. I am good at READMEs.... I would like to strengthen my over all understanding of the project that we are going to code. Strengthen my ability to read the code confidently. I would like to develop a greater strength in contribution and ideas.
#### Jim
- I would like to further develop my techinical skillset throghout the course of this project. I enjoy colloraborating with other software developers, as well as working on new things. I plan to take a regular, consistent approach to the daily work, trying to avoid falling behind or relying on longer sesssions to catch up from work that should have been done on previous work days. 
#### Zayah
- Strong debugging strategies. Breaking down and testing code will be important to keep things moving and functioning. I need to improve on frequent commits. I plan to discuss changes and work as a group on functionality.
#### Luis
- I am a strong team player who enjoys working in groups. Looking to further enhance my ability to write code that minimizes time and space complexity.
#### Hugo üíÖ
- I feel like if I'm hooked on a project, I can blast through it. I like working with others and coding is my passion! 
- Things I want to improve on, my WORK ETHIC. While if I'm passionate I can really crunch through something, I can also get distracted and let things fall by the wayside. I'm looking to improve that and become someone who can be relied upon to get things done far better than I do right now.

### Conflict Plan

- What will be your group‚Äôs process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - When there is a disagreement that team members cannot resolve on their own, it will be brought to the group. From there, the discussion will continue and each side will be able to bring forward their case. If necessary, a vote will be held to determine the best way to proceed. 
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  - If any one team member appears to be dominating the project 
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?


### Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

- What hours will you be available to communicate? 
    - Regular class hours for all, working hours during the day.
- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone ‚Ä¶)?
  - Slack, remo, zoom
- How often will you take breaks?
    - every hour for ~ 10 minutes for those who want to. 
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
    - If we begin to fall behind, their will be a strong refocus on the MVP and we will remove extra features. 
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? 
  - Slack
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone‚Äôs voice is heard?
  - By having regular stopping perior where everyone in the group can speak their mind, and share with the group what their ideas are. 
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  - By brutally assaulting those who make people uncomfortable. 

### Work Plan

- Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on ‚Äúmeaty‚Äù problems. This should prevent ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù efforts and ‚Äúsiloed‚Äù efforts.

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? 
  - MVP will be decided through a group concensus, and the tasks will be assigned to the individuals based on their interest and ability. Volunteers for any assignment will be taken before any assignment is forced onto anyone. 
What project management tool will be used?
    - Presentation Deck
    - Trello

### Presentation Deck 

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

### Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your ‚Äúpractice run‚Äù of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

- Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
- When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the ‚Äúaudience‚Äù / camera.
- Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYour smiles can be heard over the phone‚Äù

### Git Process

Plan out what your team‚Äôs Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
    - All of it 
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
    - VS Live share
- What is your Git flow?
    - add, commit, push
- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
    - How many people must review a PR?
        - 1 other person?
    - Who merges PRs?
        - the person who did NOT commit the changes.
    - How often will you merge?
        - After every major feature is done.
    - How will you communicate that it‚Äôs time to merge?
        - Slack/Remo
